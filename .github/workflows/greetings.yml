            👋 Hello @${{ github.actor }}, thank you for submitting a 🚀 PR! To allow your work to be integrated as seamlessly as possible, we advise you to:
            - ✅ Verify your PR is **up-to-date with origin/master.** If your PR is behind origin/master update by running the following, replacing 'feature' with the name of your local branch:
            ```bash
            git remote add upstream https://github.com/MichaelZaslavsky/social-event-manager.git
            git fetch upstream
            git checkout feature  # <----- replace 'feature' with local branch name
            git rebase upstream/master
            git push -u origin -f
            ```
            - ✅ Verify all Continuous Integration (CI) **checks are passing**.
            - ✅ Reduce changes to the absolute **minimum** required for your bug fix or feature addition. _"It is not daily increase but daily decrease, hack away the unessential. The closer to the source, the less wastage there is."_  -Bruce Lee
